# satisfactory-save-format
Repository containing the scripts I used to dissect the save files of Satisfactory.

Contains two scripts to convert to a readable json format and back to a sav file.

```
usage: sav2json.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--pretty] FILE

Converts Satisfactory save games into a more readable format
```

```
usage: json2sav.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] FILE

Converts from the more readable format back to a Satisfactory save game
```
